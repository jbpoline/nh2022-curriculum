It's assumed that the reader has at least a little bit of prior programming experience; the emphasis is primarily on (a) demonstrating how basic things are done in Python, and (b) reviewing the many strengths of Python (and okay, also a few weaknesses).\n",

Novice or less experienced programmers may find some of the concepts covered here—particularly the later sections (e.g., object-oriented programming)—difficult. If this is your experience, don't be alarmed! Programming computers is a fundamentally hard thing to do. The fact that this notebook is titled \"a brief introduction\" shouldn't fool you into thinking that one learns to become a proficient programmer in just a few hours of reading and experimentation. Readers will undoubtedly get more or less out of different parts of this tutorial depending on their prior experience; the hope is just that at least *some* part of the tutorial will be helpful to almost anyone looking to learn Python.]"

    "\n",
    "### Easy to learn\n",
    "Programming is hard, so, in an absolute sense, no programming language is easy to learn unless you already have prior programming experience. But, comparatively speaking, Python's high-level nature (see next section), readable syntax, and use of semantic whitespace make the language easier to pick up than many others. For example, below is a (deliberately uncommented) definition of a simple Python function that converts a string of English words to (crummy) Pig Latin:"

    "Pig Latin aside, the code is fairly easy to read (\"easy\" is relative, of course; I'm not suggesting that a novice programmer with no Python experience should be able to scan the code and immediately understand what's going on at every step!). There are several reasons for this. First, the code is written at a high level of abstraction (more on this below), so that each line of code maps onto a fairly intuitive operation like \"take the first character of this word\", and not onto a less intuitive lower-level operation like \"reserve 1 byte of memory for a character I'm going to hand you in a moment\". Second, the control structures (i.e., for-loops, if-then conditionals, etc.) use words like `in`, `and`, and `not`, rather than mysterious-looking operators. Third, Python's strict control of indentation (more on this later) imposes a level of discipline that keeps code readable while also preventing certain very common kinds of errors. And fourth, the Python community's strong emphasis on adhering to style conventions and writing \"Pythonic\" code means that Python programmers, more so than those working in many other languages, tend to use consistent naming conventions, line lengths, programming idioms, and many other similar features that collectively make it easier to read someone else's code (though admittedly this is more a feature of the community rather than the language itself)."

    "### High-level\n",
    "Python features a high level of abstraction. Many operations that must be invoked explicitly in lower-level languages (e.g., C or C++) are performed implicitly in Python. For example, you almost never have to explicitly allocate memory or collect garbage in Python—it's all done for you. Put simply, Python lets you write code faster than in many other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic\n",
    "Python code is interpreted at run-time: there's no compilation process (well, this isn't entirely true, but close enough), and code is read line-by-line when executed. The upside of this is it eliminates a common choke-point in development (i.e., waiting for code to compile), and facilitates very fast iteration. It also means variables can be dynamically typed (more on that below). The downside is that, as with other dynamic languages, Python is often considerably slower than compiled languages—at least when performing operations that can't be easily optimized and/or bound to pre-existing code written in a compiled language. (You wouldn't, for example, want to write a 3d game engine in Python.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### General-purpose\n",
    "In contrast to many other dynamic programming languages designed to fill specific niches, Python is well suited for a very wide range of applications. It features a comprehensive standard library (i.e., the functionality available out-of-the-box when you install Python) and an enormous ecosystem of third-party packages. It also supports multiple programming paradigms to varying extents (object-oriented, functional, etc.). Consequently, Python is used in many areas of software development (data science, back-end web development, DevOps, scripting engines, etc.)."

The two are easy to confuse, and in practice, you can use a list in most places where you can use a tuple (though there are some important exceptions we won't cover here). The main difference between lists and tuples is that lists are *mutable*, meaning, they can change after initialization. Tuples are *immutable*; once a tuple has been created, it can no longer be modified.\n",

    "## Everything in Python is an object\n",
    "The discussion so far might give you the impression that some data types in Python are basic or special in some way. It's natural to think, for example, that strings, integers, and booleans are \"primitive\" data types—i.e., that they're built into the core of the language, behave in special ways, and can't be duplicated, or modified. And this is true in many other programming languages. For example, in Java, there are exactly 8 primitive data types. If you get bored of them, you're out of luck. You can't just create new ones—say, a new type of string that behaves just like the primitive strings, but adds some additional stuff you think would be kind of cool to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is different: it doesn't *really* have any primitive data types. Python is a deeply object-oriented programming language, and in Python, *everything is an object*. Strings are objects, integers are objects, booleans are objects. So are collections. So are dictionaries. Everything is an object. We'll explore some of the deeper implications of this later. For now, let's focus on what it means for the way we write Python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The dot notation\n",
    "Let's start with the dot (`.`) notation we use to indicate that we're accessing data or functionality inside a method. You've probably already noticed that there are two kinds of constructions we've been using in our code to do things with variables. There's the functional syntax, where we pass an object as an argument to a function:"

So, when we write `phrase.lower()`, we're essentially saying, \"try to call the `lower()` method that's contained inside of `phrase`. (I'm being a bit sloppy here for the sake of simplicity, but that's the gist of it.)\n",

But that functionality is a feature of the string type itself, and *not* of the Python language in general.\n",

For the moment, the main point to take away is that almost all functionality in Python is going to be accessed via objects. The dot notation is ubiquitous in Python, so you'll need to get used to it quickly if you're used to a purely functional syntax."
