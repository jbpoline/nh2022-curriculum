It's assumed that the reader has at least a little bit of prior programming experience; the emphasis is primarily on (a) demonstrating how basic things are done in Python, and (b) reviewing the many strengths of Python (and okay, also a few weaknesses).\n",

Novice or less experienced programmers may find some of the concepts covered here—particularly the later sections (e.g., object-oriented programming)—difficult. If this is your experience, don't be alarmed! Programming computers is a fundamentally hard thing to do. The fact that this notebook is titled \"a brief introduction\" shouldn't fool you into thinking that one learns to become a proficient programmer in just a few hours of reading and experimentation. Readers will undoubtedly get more or less out of different parts of this tutorial depending on their prior experience; the hope is just that at least *some* part of the tutorial will be helpful to almost anyone looking to learn Python.]"

This can take a bit of getting used to, but once you do, it has important benefits: there's much less variability in coding style across different Python developers, and reading other people's code is often much easier than it is in languages without semantic whitespace.\n",

    "Python is a high-level, dynamic programming language, which people often associated with flexibility and lack of precision (e.g., you don't have to type your variables when you declare them in Python). But in some ways, Python is actually much more of a stickler than most other dynamic languages about the way Python developers write their code. We just saw that Python is very serious about how you indent your code. Another thing that's characteristic of Python is that it takes *namespacing* very seriously.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're used to languages like, say, R or MATLAB, you might expect to have hundreds of different functions available to call as soon as you fire up an interactive prompt. In Python, the *built-in namespace*—i.e., the set of functions you can invoke when you start running Python—is [very small](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). This is by design: Python expects you to carefully manage the code you use, and it's particularly serious about making sure you maintain orderly namespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this means that any time you want to use some code that's not available to you in your current [scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)), you need to explicitly *import* it from whatever module it's currently in, via an `import` statement. Python's import system often annoys beginners, because it forces them to write additional lines of code that other languages dson't. But once you get used to it, you'll find that it substantially increases code clarity and almost completely eliminates naming conflicts and confusion.\n",

We're now in a position to unpack that statement. What does it mean to say that something is an object? How do objects get defined? And how do we specify what an object should do when a certain operation is applied to it? To answer these question, we need to introduce the notion of *classes*—and, more generally, the *object-oriented programming* (OOP) paradigm.\n",

There *is* technically a difference between types and classes in Python, but it's quite subtle (especially in Python 3), and in day-to-day usage, you can use the terms interchangeably and nobody is going to yell at you.\n",

    "### Magic methods\n",
    "There's a *lot* more we could say about how classes work in Python, and about object-oriented programming in general, but this is just a brief introduction, so we have to be picky. Let's introduce just one other big concept: *magic methods*. Magic methods of objects, as we've seen a couple of times now, start and end with a double underscore: `__init__`, `__getattr__`, `__new__`, and so on. As their names suggest, these methods are magic—at least in the sense that they appear to add some magic to a class's behavior. We've already talked about `__init__`, which is a magic method that gets called any time we create a new instance of a class. But there are many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to understanding how magic methods work is to recognize that they're usually called implicitly when a certain operation is applied to an object—even if it doesn't look like the magic method and the operation being applied have anything to do with each other (that's what makes them magic!). Remember how we said earlier that *everything in Python is an object*? Well now we're going to explore one of the deeper implications of that observation, which is that *all operators in Python are actually just cleverly-disguised method calls*. That means that when we write even an expression as seemingly basic as `4 * 3` in Python, it's actually implicitly converted to a call to a magic method on the first operand (4), with the second operand (3) being passed in as an argument.\n",

Even something as seemingly basic as the multiplication operator is actually just an alias to a method called on an integer object! Isn't that neat?\n",

Does every valid occurrence of `*` in Python code imply that the object just before the `*` must be an instance of a class that implements the `__mul__` method? The answer is yes! The result of an expression that includes the `*` operator (and for that matter, every other operator in Python, including things like `==` and `&`) is entirely dependent on the receiver object's implementation of `__mul__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to make it clear how far-reaching the implications of this principle are, let's look at how a couple of other built-in Python types deal with the `*` operator. Let's start with strings. What do you think will happen when we multiply a string object by 2?"

And there's no particular reason a string class *shouldn't* implement the `__mul__` method; why not define *some* behavior for it, even if it's counterintuitive?
