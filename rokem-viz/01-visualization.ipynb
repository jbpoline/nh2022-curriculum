    "## Introducing Matplotlib \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will start with Matplotlib. This may very well end up being your tool of choice for most of your visualizations. There are a few reasons to get started there. The first is that it may very well be the easiest of all of these to teach and to learn. It is also a pretty good choice, becuase it is very popular in the scientific Python ecosystem, and because it is a very well-supported by a large community of developers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib was started by a neuroscientist, John Hunter, while he was a postdoc at the University of Chicago. Within a few years, together with the rest of the scientific Python ecosystem, Matplotlib took off in popularity, and John left neuroscience to work at a Chicago-based hedge-fund, while still maintaining the library. Having learned about the challenges of software sustainability, he was among the founders of Numfocus, which is a non-profit that serves as the fiscal sponsor for many projects in this ecosystem (enabling them to take contributions, accept grants, and so on). The community around Matplotlib grew and now encompasses more than 1,000 contributors. The library and its visual style became familiar through images such as the images that described the first recording of gravitational waves by the LIGO collaboration: \n",

    "Presenting graphical information is complicated business and Matplotlib is a rather large and complicated library. There are different ways to call functions that would do similar things, depending on the level of detail that you would like to adopt. This makes it a bit hard, because you have to decide at which level you would like to call Matplotlib. However, there is one particular API that is almost always the right choice for a good balance of flexibility and expressivity, and I strongly recommend to always use this API. This is the API that we will learn here. First, we import the sub-module that contains this particular API, `matplolib.pyplot`.

One of the classical visualizations for this purpose is the Box plot. This plot follows a simple set of conventions to display the median and quantiles (box and red horizontal line), as well as the range of values within 1.5 * IQR from each quartile. Values outside of that are considered outliers."

    "Notice that the default color-map used by Matplotlib to designate the different intensities in each voxel in this image is called \"viridis\". It goes from dark blue through shades of green to yellow. One of the merits of this color-map (in stark contrast to many other color-maps that are in widespread use in neuroscience) is that the colors change from low values to high values not only in their hue, but also -- _in a monotonic and linear fashion_ -- from dark to bright. This is important, because it means that the salience of different parts of the image corresponds to how bright they are, which is directly related to the values represented. \n",
