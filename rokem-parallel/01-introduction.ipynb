    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing code in python is easy: because it is dynamically typed, we don’t have to worry to much about declaring variable types (e.g. integers vs. floating point numbers). Also, it is interpreted, rather than compiled. Taken together, this means that we can avoid a lot of the boiler-plate that makes compiled, statically typed languages hard to read. However, this incurs a major drawback: performance for some operations can be quite slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever possible, the numpy array representation is helpful in saving time. But not all operations can be vectorized. What do you do when you need to speed up your code, but can’t rely on vectorization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we’ll mention two general approaches to speeding up code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first is the main topic of this tutorial, parallelization. One of the reasons that Python can be slow is that it does one thing at a time. Technically, this is because to make sure that it doesn't corrupt data and/or memory, and so that basic operations run reasonably fast, Python runs on a single thread at any given time. This is implemented in the so-called Global Interpreter Lock, or GIL. Here, we'll explore one (of many!) approach to parallelization, using a software library called Dask. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The other approach -- which we will not explore in this tutorial -- is to compile your Python code into something faster, and then call the compiled code from with Python. There are two ways to do that: \n",
    "    - Sometimes, your only choice in speeding up code is to write extension code in C, but this is very cumbersome, and requires writing many lines of additional code above and beyond your core algorithms, just to communicate between the Python and C computation layers. [Cython](https://cython.org/) is a technology that allows us to easily bridge between python, and the underlying C representations. The main purpose of the library is to take code that is written in python, and, provided some additional amount of (mostly type) information, compile it to C, compile the C code, and bundle the C objects into python extensions that can then be imported directly into python.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) and [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) also compile your code to machine code, but they both take a distinctly different approach. Instead of translating your Python code to C, and then compiling that down to machine code, they compile the code “just in time”, at the time that the code is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we dive into parallelization, we need to find a way to know whether what we are doing is even helping."

    "### The IPython `timeit` magic\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Jupyter Python notebook, you can use a ‘magic’ function to time either a single statement, or multiple statements. For example, the following shows us how one operation scales with the size of the data. In this case, the %timeit magic only times the operation on that line."
