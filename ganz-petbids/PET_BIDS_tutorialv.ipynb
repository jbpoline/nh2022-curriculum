a recent addition to BIDS with its introduction via BEP 009. If you're interested in seeing exactly what and how something gets added to BIDS see the pull request for BEP009 [here](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/633). The results of that extension proposal can be read [here](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/09-positron-emission-tomography.html#positron-emission-tomography) in the bids standard.\n\n# PET data conversion\n\n## PET image data file formats\n\n\nBefore we start to convert data we need to quickly mention that PET image data files come of the scanner in various different formats, some scanners provide DICOM files (.dcm) and others use proprietary formats for example ECAT format (.v) . In order to facilitate easy testing of data conversion across different PET file formats  the [OpenNeuroPET project](https://openneuropet.github.io/) has compiled a bunch of phantom data from different scanner types and is distributing two examples [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10S0H7HAnMmxHNpZLlifR14ykIuiXcBAD/view?usp=sharing) .

The main tool used for this is [PET2BIDS](https://github.com/openneuropet/PET2BIDS) freely available on the [OpenNeuroPET  GitHub repository](https://github.com/openneuropet) along with other resources like altlases or pipelines. It is available for both Python and MatLab. Eventually, [PET2BIDS](https://github.com/openneuropet/PET2BIDS) will also be wrapped inside other BIDS conversion tools such as [BIDScoin](https://github.com/Donders-Institute/bidscoin) or [ezBIDS](https://brainlife.io/ezbids/), but this is work in progress at the moment. \n\nBesides using  [PET2BIDS](https://github.com/openneuropet/PET2BIDS) there is always the possibility to manually convert a data set to PET BIDS and an example will be shown below. In any case, for dicom data format, one relies on [dcm2niix](https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii:MainPage).\n\nBelow we will show two ways of converting your PET data to BIDS: 1) using [PET2BIDS](https://github.com/openneuropet/PET2BIDS) and 2) manually.\n\n### 1) Conversion of PET data using PET2BIDS\n\nDetailed documentation for PET2BIDS can be found [here](https://pet2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) or on the [Github repo](https://github.com/openneuropet/PET2BIDS/blob/main/README.md).\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"5d08c74c"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Get the Python package PET2BIDS\n\nWe have already installed it via ''pip install pypet2bids '' above.

Therefore we need to clone that GitHub repository. Before we do that, let's make a separate folder for it and move into it:\n","metadata":{},"id":"da992445-21f4-4537-96a6-2a2c98da764f"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!mkdir PETprocessing","metadata":{},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[],"id":"c7da97ff"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!cd PETprocessing","metadata":{},"execution_count":43,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'PETprocessing'\n/home/jovyan/PETprocessing\n","output_type":"stream"}],"id":"cdf36a9c-748c-46bd-8280-ae41ecca6ba2"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!git clone https://github.com/openneuropet/PET_pipelines.git .","metadata":{},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Cloning into '.'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 54, done.\u001b[K\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (54/54), done.\u001b[K\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (51/51), done.\u001b[K\nremote: Total 54 (delta 12), reused 22 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\u001b[K\nReceiving objects: 100% (54/54), 30.45 KiB | 2.54 MiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (12/12), done.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"id":"931b2967-b3c4-4a52-946e-dd2c3361bb4e"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Then we need to cd to the right directory inside the Github repository:","metadata":{},"id":"68ca8349"},{"cell_type":"code","source":" !cd pyPetSurfer ","metadata":{},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[],"id":"b405f875"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Download this example dataset from OpenNeuro: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001421.
