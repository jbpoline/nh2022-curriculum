This is a version of the tutorial also available in https://github.com/MultimodalNeuroimagingLab/bpc_jupyter.

This Jupyter notebook is a tutorial for how to calculate Basis Profile Curve for intracranial EEG data during single pulse stimulation as described in: 

Miller KJ, MÃ¼ller K-R, Hermes D (2021) Basis profile curve identification to understand electrical stimulation effects in human brain networks. PLoS Comput Biol 17(9): e1008710. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008710

Please cite this work when using the code. 

This Jupyter notebook is a translation of the Matlab code developed used for this publication and was written by Tal Pal Attia, Harvey Huang and Dora Hermes, 2021.
